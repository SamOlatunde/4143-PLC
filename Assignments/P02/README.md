## Project Background
In this program we will try and show some advantages of Go when compared to C++ and Python. Every high level language has its strengths, and I think Golang's can be seen in its similarity to both aforementioned languages, but more so in its library availability. Not as strong as Python's but more so than C++'s. I would like us to create Go's version of a class, that will do some rudimentary image manipulation.

## ImageManipulator
This is a basic walkthrough to create a package that contains Go's version of a class that will be used inside a module with a main.go file that uses it. A project structured at its most basic, but will implement basic image editing, which is not something that you see everyday in lower level C++ courses.
