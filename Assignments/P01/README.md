## P01 - Run a Go Program
### Samuel Olatunde 
### Description:

In this assignment, we implement [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MXIGYrMk80) YouTube tutorial on visual studio code. The tutorial has us do the following:
* Write a Go package that checks to see what mascot you choose
* Implement a main.go to file to run the mascot package
* Create a test to check your package is running correctly

Additionally, the program uses the quote.go package to print a quote on the console
